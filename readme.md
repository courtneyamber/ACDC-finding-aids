# ACDC Finding Aid Project
#### Completed for IS 452: Foundations of Information Processing
------------------------------

### Project Overiew 
--------------------
The goal of this project was to first create inventories for each of the Agricultural Communications Documentation Center's Contributor Collections, and secondly, using these inventories, create finding aids for each collection.  The program created for this project was successful in creating draft inventories and finding aids for the ACDC, but future data-cleaning on the ACDC's records in BibLeaves will need to take place along with the completion of final finding aids.  

### How to run the code...
--------------------------------
In order to run this code, you will need to download three files: the program itself (either acdc-fas.py or acdc-fas-comments.py), the ACDC's records (acdc-records.csv), and the finding aid template (fa_template.txt).  The ACDC's records and the finding aid template are already set to read into the program, so once you are set to run the program, just be sure that these two files are located in the same directory as the program.  After running the program, three files for each collection will output: a raw inventory, a structured inventory, and a finding aid.  

If you wish to only output a portion of the files, comment out a portion of the strings in the list "collections".
